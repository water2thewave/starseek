In rituals, as our ancestors did, use this time to be aware of our human bodies. 
The time on the computer is a physiologically intensive activity our bodies aren't biologically
attuned to. Pixels were invented in the last 100 years, we've only had a handful of generations
to cycle our genes. I don't think our eyes have evolutionarily changed from our great-great-grandparents.
