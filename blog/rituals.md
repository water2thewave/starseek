> ~~Shared~~ Cloned rituals make a tradition.

This file is important to explaining how the code
structure and workspace is used. There isn't
enough time to automate everything, nor should it
all be. Rituals help automate the humans writing
the code with the flexibility of free will.

They don't have to be followed, but doing so
should streamline the coding process. 

It will also help decide where direction for future improvement.
Writing your own set of rituals allows the coder to experience
how the workflow is designed to be used. It keeps them focused
on the project. Necessary context is localized.


> In code, start and stop in concentrated sessions
> Begin and end with the same rituals
> For the plants and animals dance in circles with sun and moon
> And too, the sun and moon to their family that light the sky
>
> Write two languages: two for machine, two for human.
> One goes to machine to interact, the other for the being.
> 
> As seeds of nature, we place firm roots
> Look to the sky, to the very tree top
> Keep your back straight
>
> Review what you did last time
> diff demo of what changed
> Review how far your branch was from main
> Observe how it's working now
> 
> Write your intention of blog for that session
> Create blog post for session
> Create branch for session
> 
> Create a new branch for the session
> Write your commits as a story watching the app grow
> Note observations of tendencies, habits, frustrations, nature 
> in blog
>
> Recommit at the final commit to sum everything up
> Make merge commit to parent branch
> 
> Review diff demo
> Review code changes
> Observe 2d code structures
> Note the docs and sections most referenced
> Continue the story as a blog developer
> who has observed the app grow 
> and redesigns how the app can grow smoothly
>
> Read the rituals to guide the session close.
> Recite the license to make clear your role and the code's role
>
> purify the mind by commiting publicly
> fear not the scrutiny of others, as this clone is your tradition

In rituals, as our ancestors did, use this time to be aware of our human bodies. 
The time on the computer is a physiologically intensive activity our bodies aren't biologically
attuned to. Pixels were invented in the last 100 years, we've only had a handful of generations
to cycle our genes. I don't think our eyes have evolutionarily changed from our great-great-grandparents.

We'll keep our eyes alert, active, and well-rested by doing concentrated focused sessions.
We can keep them short, stay effective, and conscious.

Rituals keep us conscious of our physical body and its role in something
as abstract as coding. By formalizing and cementing our code in rituals,
we can stay conscious of our breathing, our hands, our body to maintain
an effective human system. After all, it's the thing piloting the growth
of the app.

We keep these rituals to stay conscious of what we're writing,
and to stay focused on what we wrote. That is the only reality
that really exists in the end.
