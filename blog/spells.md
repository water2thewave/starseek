Spells are streamlined into computers.

We can type out incantations onto silicon and gold, and the god of lightning will travel the 
metal, communicate with the god of sound/vibrations/air to send the message along. The god of lightning
helps humans out by granting them the ability to transcribe messages to the other gods of the senses and elements
via gold and silicon. 

Fine sages, with their quick intellect to split and join, noticed the on/off of electrons 
matched the matched the ever apparent phenomena we call the cycle of duality: life and death, day and night, hot to cold, up to down.  

They got wise, and projected entire universes from this truth encoded into 0-1. 
The binarian sages sat under trees, writing in pages to describe matter/form in purely 0s and 1s. They drew trees.
They took it to the machinarians, who ran it in their clocks. They described created time and motion.
The clocks controlled the periods when foreigners, merchants, travellers, bureaucrats
people could traverse the town, and when they had to wait by the gate. The gate had several chambers,
each with a guard asking a single question leading you to a pair of doors. One would may take you outside,
or to the next chamber, finally reaching the city.

The asmiirs took notice of the strike of the clock, design of the gates, flow of people, and wrote
building plans based on these phenomena.

This turned into metal working for humans, commanding hardware to do the physical or mental labor of
the many by one pulse.

They wrote it into a multitude of vast languages for ordinary humans to understand
