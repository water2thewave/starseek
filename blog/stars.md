# Stars and Constellations

## Star

A *star* is a name given to data. It's the CID of a constellation.

The blockchain commits stars ("Qmbp5ae9UdBjDPR1H66rA5q4Dj7n6rcwCdVFurTrWr8w1s")
to the chain. 

For example, "QmeNDxukCABiFAT5c3CbS74rv4bqU37vRUBm8DctbBUf4H" is the name of a star.

Star addressing system is IPFS CIDs.

# Constellations

Constellations represent data. It is the raw JSON.

The graph of connected
stars are called 


# Example

Suppose we want to convey some information. We have a constellation
here:

```
{
  "word": "Self"
}
```

It's just a JSON file. We give it to IPFS and it gives our constellation
a name, "QmeNDxukCABiFAT5c3CbS74rv4bqU37vRUBm8DctbBUf4H". This is the CID
that IPFS gives it, we call it the constellation's seed. Once IPFS
gives us our CID, the star is officially in the sky. We can find it
if we search the sky for "QmeNDxukCABiFAT5c3CbS74rv4bqU37vRUBm8DctbBUf4H".
We need to remember that name if we want to see it again.

"QmeNDxukCABiFAT5c3CbS74rv4bqU37vRUBm8DctbBUf4H" is a hard name to remember,
so we use a committee that maintains a record of all the stars we've made.
That committee, for a small fee, engraves your seed onto a blockchain so
you can remember it. Pay for the convenience of keeping track of these
constellations.
